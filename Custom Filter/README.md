## Mini Project: Case Conversion Filters

AngularJS already comes with two built-in case filters: uppercase and lowercase.

Youâ€™re working on a team that needs the following case filters:

* CamelCaseUpper
* camelCaseLower
* snake-case-hyphens
* snake_case_underscores_lower
* SNAKE_CASE_UNDERSCORES_UPPER

You will form in teams of 4 max (one team per table?) and implement one of the cases assigned to you. You will clone this project and create a branch. Once completed, create a PR to submit your changes. We will see each of the implementations in action at the end of class and see how well everyone did. Have fun!
